        <div class="subheading mb-5">Anthropology ðŸŒŽ</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello everyone! I am Zaria Poteat, a current first year at University of California Riverside. I am currently majoring in Anthropology which is the study of human societies and their development. One of the most recent jobs I have had is being a poll worker. Even before becoming a poll worker I had to dedicate time to school to get the proper training in order to become a poll worker. Once the day finally came, I arrived at my assigned station and went to work. On the job I learned how to set up the electronic poll stations, the check in tablets, and organized the actual poll sheets themselves. During the course of the work day I helped a plethora of people perform their civic right to vote which I realized to be more important than I ever imagined. Within this I saw how important it is to help communities come together and flourish even though a job may seem like a minute one, there is still tremendous importance to it.
 <br><br>

       Another job I have had that stressed the importance of community was joining my high schoolâ€™s Hispanic club. By joining this club I learned a lot about the Hispanic cultures whether it be through different dances and songs, old stories from Mesoamerica or from little objects like worry dolls. By learning all this new information I was able to spread more information about Hispanic cultures to my peers and create a community that was more understanding of each other despite all the different walks of life. In addition to sharing information, I also helped the club to raise money in order to go on educational field trips and buy outfits for my school's annual culture performances.<br><br>

        The activity that taught me the most was joining my high schoolâ€™s cheer team. By trying out I learned how to be dedicated to the task at hand as well as putting aside dedicated time to perfect my craft. In addition to this I learned that doing good by yourself is only so good when you have a team of people to work with. Cheer taught me how to work as a team extensively through both calm and hard times. Building a strong community was so important as peopleâ€™s lives could be at stake very quickly, but having strong trust mitigated that obstacle. All of these skills are essential to be an anthropologist as one needs to have the trust of their being studied, patience for learning things that are not in my comfort zone, and further bringing a community together and not the opposite.
